# Lucas's Notes

> To know is to produce

## What is this?

My notes on...a lot of stuff. I hope that this will eventually be a life times worth of material structured for me by me. Information writen by me to reinforce the synapis as they are construted. Organized to further salitify said information. Searched over and over as a reference until the information is readily available without a seconds thought, when the situation deems.

> Knowledge not redilty availbe when it is advantagous is useless.

## Why is this?

This site is the result of many different factors. Not the least of which has been an obession with note taking ever since I was a teenager. I have alway felt dejected with my hand written note books. A hand written note book is not reviseable. It is not iterateable. If you take the notes from a book or a course. You are following the pedigocial landscape that the teacher, team, instructors has deemed as _ideal_. At least in my expierece there is always another perspective. A new position on the informations if you take a step to the left or the right. The digital space allows for this development as an understanding of the enviroment of a knwowledge space evolves.

 Without getting to philosophical.

> To learn is not to know, memory makes one and the application of knowledge toward discovery makes the other.
