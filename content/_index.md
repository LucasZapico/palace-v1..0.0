# Lucas's Notes

> To know is to produce.

This is the latest attempt to document, order and showcase my learning.

###  Objectives

## What is this?

I could say that this has been a life long pursuit and this particular expression began in 2017. I started by using [Atom](https://atom.io/) and markdown to "just get notes down". The drive being to have a central palace of knowledge that I build myself and thereby know where everything is, how it is curated and further reinforcing previous knowledge by traversing the same paths. 
Because, no matter how amazing Google is, websites change, reworked, comments are deleted, Youtube videos are taken down and we forget domains and twitter handles that had amazing insight. These are just the issues with regards to digital information and I am not even touching on literary. 
This project is my attempt to keep the power readily available and continually strengthened until I know longer need to reference this palace to use pertinent knowledge to solve a challenge. Think of it is as organizing ones own house. 


My notes on...a lot of stuff. The objectives for this repository are;
1. Reinforce all of the courses, tools, and books which I have used to 
2. Is to give me a quite  I hope that this will eventually be a life times worth of material structured for me by me. 

> Knowledge not readily available when it is advantageous is useless.

## Why is this?

This site is the result of many different factors. Not the least of which has been an obession with note taking ever since I was a teenager. I have alway felt dejected with my hand written note books. A hand written note book is not reviseable. It is not iterateable. If you take the notes from a book or a course. You are following the pedigocial landscape that the teacher, team, instructors has deemed as _ideal_. At least in my expierece there is always another perspective. A new position on the informations if you take a step to the left or the right. The digital space allows for this development as an understanding of the enviroment of a knwowledge space evolves.

 Without getting to philosophical.
