### Catch Notes

> Probability is Simply how likely something is to happen


-   The probability of an event can only be between 0 and 1
-   Probability of event A is written as $P(A)$
-   If $P(A)>P(B)$, then event A has a higher chance of occurring
-   If P(A)=P(B), then A and B are equally likely to occur
    

#### Probability Axioms

1.  __Non-negativity__: [$P(A)\ge 0 $], for every event A.
2.  __Additivity__: If $A$ and $B$ are two _disjoint_ events, then the probability of their union satisfies..
    [$$ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) $$]
    More generally, if the sample space has an infinite number of elements and $A_1,A_2,...$ is a sequence of disjoint events, then the probability of their union satisfies..
    [$$ P(A_1, \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \cup...) = P(A_1)+P(A_2)+....$$]

3.  __Normalization__: The probability of the entire sample space [$ \Omega $] is equal to 1, that is, [$ P(\Omega ) = 1 $]


**Probability by outcome**: A well defined experiment in which all outcomes are equally likely.

>the number of successful the outcomes/ number of total outcomes


```
 Example: Flipping a fair coin.
  Given:

 -   There exist only two possible outcomes 'heads' 'tails'
 -   Each outcome is equally likely. (Implied implicitly by the term fair)
```
###### subset of the **sample space** are **events**

[Brilliant]()

```
 Example: Given a fair coin. What is the probability of heads on flip.

 p(H) = ? </br></br> # of possibilities where the condition is met/ # of equally likely possibilities
   p(H) = 1 (possible event where a single flip will be heads) / 2 (equally likely possible events in our sample space)
      </br> Therefore, </br>
 p(H)=1/2 = 50% probability
```
###### _coin flips and dice roles are independent events_

#### Introductory Statistics

##### Descriptive Statistics

Statistics is the use of facts or data, either numerical, organized and summarized so as to provide useful and accessible information about a particular subject and the science of organizing and summarizing numerical or nonnumerical informations.

##### Descriptive statistics: is the act of organizing and summarizing information.

### Definitions

__fair__
: Each of our outcomes are equally likely to occur

__sample space__
: The sample space of an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes of that experiment

__event__
: An **event** is some subset of the sample space.
    Example:: Experiment: fair dice role
    \- event 1: the outcome is even
    \- event 2: the outcome is less then three
