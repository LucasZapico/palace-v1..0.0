There are two fundemental models of knowledge that this project and for that matter my life is based on.

__General Mind__
: The general mind is the aggragation and form of knowledge and information that a culture has. 

The general mind is a term I coined to describe the knowledge that resides in a culture. The more valuable the knowledge is to the disposition and priorities of the people the more models and mnemonic device a culture will come up with the convey the given concept, idea, value etc. 

*The premise is the greater value a node of knowledge is to a culture the easier it will be to learn due solely to the fact that by incentives the entities of that culture will come up with more efficient methods to convey said knowledge. Because it is deemed as advantageous.*
