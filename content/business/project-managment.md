#### 12 Step Process
1. Clearly define the project </br>
**The Rest is Planing**
2. List all task
3. Estimate times and cost for each tasks
4. add up time and cost
5. shorten you project plan
6. Draw a Gantt chart
7. Calculate resource requirements over time
8. Assess risks and prepare action plans </br>
**Monitor**
9. Monitor progress
10. Monitor cost
11. Reschedule
12. Review: learn and praise __KEY__

## Step 1: Define Your Project

- __COST__
- __QUALITY__
- __TIME__


###### _?Which is the key Driver?_

COST QUALITY TIME

note: Which is the non comprimizable constraint

__WHY__

__WHAT IF__

__CAN WE TRADE?__

#### Facilitate Clear Agreement of Project Scope
>Example: a meeting of all stakeholders to discuss and to initial clearly define
> project scope. (Make sure all stakeholders are on the same page)

Note: Two meetings are best case.
1. Initial meeting to hash out top level (find out what they want)
2. Once a plan has been developed (decide and sign off/commit)
 - present options, discuss and refined documented plan

### Project Planning

#### Step 2: List Task
- Brain Storm Session
  - team
- Write out a structured tree of tasks (WBS)
  - Work Break-down Structure
- Ask others
  - consultant
  - research
  - professionals

__GRANULARITY__
How detailed
- Document task by week

###### _Never Say ON-GOING or IN-PROGRESS_
note: when you want to say On-Going break the task down into definable components so as to have

### Step 3: Estimate Times and Costs For each Task

For a given project we have want to know:
- what are the Costs
- how long are they going to take

> Example: Say you are driving  home.
> On a good day it takes 20min
> normal: 30min
> bad: 60min
> Likely, normal distribution
>
>
> *What do we tell the customer when they ask how long will the project take?*
>
>  A good practice is to go half-way between the average and the upper bound. This is 1 1/2 standard deviations from the mean. This means only 10% of the projects will be late or over budget
>

:*Vary on commercial pressures*:
- consequense for being late
-

### Step 4: Add up Time and Cost

Network Diagram

Heart of planning Process
List out any and all tasks required for the project to succeed and estimate the required for the tasks to be completed

Look for longest path: This is time constraint of our project.

### Step 5: Drawing a Gantt Chart

##### GANTT CHARTS:

- communicate
- monitor Gantt chart
- forecast resources requirements

### Step 6: Drawing a Gantt Chart
- put in critical path
  - events are shown as a line
- floats
  - express constraints

### Step 8: Risk Analysis
