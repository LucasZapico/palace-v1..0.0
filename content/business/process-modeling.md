### System and Business Diagraming



#### [Business Process Models](https://www.lynda.com/Project-Management-tutorials/Business-Process-Modeling-Fundamentals/490754-2.html)

- capture processes
- provides a visual representation
- identify what is needed.

__Example__ If a business produced a process model of what/how their business is currently operating along with a model of how they want the processes to be parsed as. The cross analysis of these two models supports the development of action strategies for how to get from model 1 to model 2. 
The state of the business today and compare to what they want them to be.

__Benefit__

- understanding of how the business runs, performs activities
- identifies areas that are not well understood
- identify complex business processes

#### Modeling and Prototyping

Modeling captures interrelationships between people, processes, activities, and systems.

##### Diagram Tools Summary

3. [Cross-Functional Flow Diagrams]()
- activity diagrams
Display the activities performed between actors/entities.

__Internationally Recognized Standards for Modeling__

[BPMN-Business Process Modeling Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Model_and_Notation)

__*Consistency and Simplicity are the key*__

### Context Diagrams
Before a decision can be made it is imperative the context in which the decision is going to be made is clear. A context diagram provides a visual view for how an organization fits in the world. The context diagram provides a high level as each component can be analyzed further by drilling down into granular models associated with a particular relationship of the business.

##### Context
How a business area interacts with the world
##### Actor
A person, department, or system that is directly involved in what is being analyzed
##### External Entity
A person, department, or system that is not being analyzed
#### Three Key Components
- __entities__: The actors that are represented in the diagram
- __relationships__:
- __processes__

#### Nomenclature:

__Circle__ represents what is control-able

__Box__ represents what can be influenced

__Arrows__ represent relationships between

- __Output__ sending an activity
- __Input__ receiving and activity


An arrow can represent;

- data
- product
- information
*__The value of a context diagram is its Simplicity__*

##### Check for developing a useful context diagram
- Research
  - interview employees
  - available documentation
- Use a single page
  - forces simple high level
