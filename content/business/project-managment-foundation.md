### Components of a project
### Project life Cycle
### Organizational Structure Affects
### PM Software options

## Project Managment
### Manage time

### Manage Quality
### Managing Project Human Resources
### Project Communication
### Manage Project Risk

## Building Project Schedule
### Sequence Tasks
#### Task dependency
When one task controls the timing of another

**finish-to-start**
: The finish of one task marks the begining of another
: __Example__ the end of scoping of a component signals the begining of design.
**finish-to-start**
: the start of one task signals the start of another
: sufficient logical relationships
: __Example__ the start of development is the start of testing

__finish-to-finish__
: The finish of one task controls the finish of another
: __Example__ Finish connecting equipment to the network is also the finish to testing of connections.
__Start-to-finish__
: The start of one task is the finish of another
: __Example:__ the start of a confrence is the finish of equipment testing.

*Which task controls the other*
*Does the start of one task control the start of another?*
*Does the finish of one task control the start of another?*

### Assign Resources to Task
Task change due to resource assignment.
__Duration__
: Is the lenght of time between when a task starts and when it ends.

__Work/Effort__
: is the number of hours or days someone works on a task

As labor changes the task duration changes.

__Example__
If a project is estimated to take 160hr of work. A team of four can only work 32hr each day. Therefore, the task will take five days.

#### Learn to use Milestones
Milestones show progress on key project points.
[Gant Charts]()
By breaking down a project into milestones. The project schedule can easily be adjusted by the the adjustment of the start and end of other milestones. This also allows for the easy at a glance view for when the project will be completed.

#### Realistic Schedule
- Labor does not work 100% of their work day.
- Multitasking negatively affects productivity. Switching between tasks measn a person has to swtich their focus. This is a loss of minimum of 20 min.

### Critical Path
The squence of task in your schedule with the longest duration. A task is critical when the delay in the finish of the task delays the finish of the project.
*A project can be shorten if the critical path can be shortened.*

The start and finish dates can be defined base on their dependencies.

### Critical Chain Method
Critical chain is
1. Schedule task to occur as late as possible. (money is spent only when it must be)
- focus on resource limitations thereby identifying the important tasks to manage.
  - Schedule tasks with the most limited resources thereby using those resources effectively and better determining the effect on the rest of the tasks.
2. The critical chain uses a buffere to give a project breathing room by grouping tasks into phases and applying a buffer to the phase as a hole so only the task that need it dig into the buffer.

### Shorten a Schedule
- **Fast Tracking**
- __Crashing__
- __Cutting Scope__

__Fast Tracking__
: overlaping task that would normally occur one after the other fihish-to-start dependencies.
: __Cost__ increases risk and possible delays if their is a mistake.
Shortening the critical path shortens the schedule

__Crashing__
: increasing cost by throwing more labor at the tasks on the critical path
- use a crash table to start with the least expensive task to crash and increase untill the timeline has been adjusted the necessary amount.

### Project Baseline
__Baseline__
: A collection of approved project documents that you want to control with you change management process.
__use__ Compare project perfomrmace to the baseline to see how the project is doing.
1. save a baseline
2. if something changes flag it in the change document.

Baseline should include;
- start and finish dates
- task duration
- work
- cost
