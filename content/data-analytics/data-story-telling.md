- Human beings are wired for story. 
- The more senses that are associated with a give word or model the more of our brain is engaged and the more redundant and resilient the information becomes.  
- statics are neutral words at a basic level they are not resilient nodes of information 
- Stories are author driven, reader drive 
  - authors driven - dashboards
- Stories are everywhere 
  - email
  - powerpoint
  - beginning middle end

- labeling 
  - clarity, context 
  - sign posts 
  - label as little as possible (labels show what is important)

- eye candy
  -   more catching visualizations should be used if and only if they are at least equally informative and accurate 
  -   story telling includes engagement and entertainment 

- redundancy 
  - repeat data and visuals 
  -
